overall feel:
    brogue
    magicka
    bloodborne
    magicka-like roguelike with spellcrafting with both eldritch and gothic horror

cast on:
    self
    surroundings
    entities
    items
        imbue potions
        enchant weapons

type:
    cloud/gas
    beam
    aura
    explosion


element:
    earth
        armor/defense
        stones
    water
        flooding/water
        healing
    air
        pushing
        flying
        stealth
    fire
        lava
        heat
        fire/fireball
    combinations:
        eunlike elements canceling out
        immunity (to certain elements)
        vulnerability (to certain elements)
        water breathing (combined with air)
        slowness
        poison
        blindness
        invisibility
        haste
        telepathy


maybe make cast on and type attributes of certain elements?
    weight each element differently towards each and then either take the consensus attribute, or maybe combinations of them?
        i.e. a beam that explodes into a cloud

multiple effects per element, which ones come out depend on which elements they're combined with
    e.g. water makes floods, gets closer to healing if mixed with air
    e.g. 

fire spreads
water flows
gasses diffuse until they reach a certain concentration (then disappear)


other notes
emphasize vertical leevel design (use different shading to denote different z levels)

ui looks like ascii spellbook with branching tree on it
    base is the cast on (focus?)
    next branching level is type
    next branching level is element and effect type
    more branches unlocked?

mana consumption based on how much 

e.g.
                    focus
                surroundings
            type (1st)    type (2nd)
            beam          cloud
        element element element element
        fire    water   earth   air
        heat    healing stones  flying
makes:
    a superheated healing beam
        heats up all tiles it passes over, especially what it hits
        regenerates everything it passes over, especially what it hits
    when it contacts something it creates a cloud of pebbles that move at incredible speed
